# Breast-cancer-Predication
**Using AI to predict breast cancer and personalize care**

Breast cancer symptoms vary widely — from lumps to swelling to skin changes — and many breast cancers have no obvious symptoms at all.  In some cases, a lump may be too small for you to feel or to cause any unusual changes you can notice on your own. Often, an abnormal area turns up on a screening mammogram (X-ray of the breast), which leads to further testing.  In other cases, however, the first sign of breast cancer is a new lump or mass in the breast that you or your doctor can feel. A lump that is painless, hard, and has uneven edges is more likely to be cancer. But sometimes cancers can be tender, soft, and rounded. 

# How it works

Since the first breast-cancer risk model from 1989, development has largely been driven by human knowledge and intuition of what major risk factors might be, such as age, family history of breast and ovarian cancer, hormonal and reproductive factors, and breast density.

However, most of these markers are only weakly correlated with breast cancer. As a result, such models still aren’t very accurate at the individual level, and many organizations continue to feel risk-based screening programs are not possible, given those limitations.

Rather than manually identifying the patterns in a mammogram that drive future cancer, the MIT/MGH team trained a deep-learning model to deduce the patterns directly from the data. Using information from more than 90,000 mammograms, the model detected patterns too subtle for the human eye to detect.

A Machine learning algorithm trained on a linked data set of mammograms and electronic health records achieved breast cancer detection accuracy comparable to radiologists as defined by the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium benchmark for screening digital mammography and revealed additional clinical risk features.
